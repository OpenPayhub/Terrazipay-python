# TerraZip ⚡  
**AI-Native Unified Payment & Collection Framework**  

TerraZip is a **An integrated payment and collection framework for AI agents and developers, designed to enable machine-to-machine transactions and enhance interaction efficiency in the age of AI.**.  
It reduces payment integration complexity by abstracting capabilities across platforms, and elevates "payment" to a **fundamental capability that can be AI-driven, orchestrated, and verified**.

## ✨ Core Features  

### 1️⃣ Unified Payments  
TerraZip aggregates mainstream payment platform APIs,  
**abstracting differences in interfaces, workflows, naming, and verification methods** to provide consistent, extensible payment capabilities.  

- Unified payment/collection abstraction  
- Unified order & payment status model  
- Pluggable adapter design for easy platform expansion  

---  

### 2️⃣ AI-Driven Payments  
TerraZip introduces **AI-native payment design**, transforming payments from simple RPC calls to capabilities that can be understood, decided, and executed by AI agents.  

- AI agent-oriented payment/collection state machine  
- Payment intent & permission boundary modeling  
- Supports AI workflow: "quotation → confirmation → authorization → payment"  
- Integrates with agent frameworks as payment module  

---  

### 3️⃣ Mock x402 Implementation  
TerraZip includes a **complete mock x402 implementation & demo** for learning, testing, and validating AI payment workflows:  

- x402 payment workflow  
- Permit/signature verification  
- Payment intent & allowance validation  
- Ready-to-run examples  

> Ideal for: learning x402, testing AI agent payments, rapid prototyping  

---  

## 🚀 Use Cases  

- AI agents automating paid API/service calls  
- Unified multi-platform payment integration (Web2/Web3)  
- AI-driven subscriptions, billing, and settlements  
- Payment-as-a-tool agent systems  

---  

## 🧭 Project Vision & Roadmap  

### Short-Term Goals  
- Aggregate **10+ major payment platforms**  
- Stabilize unified payment adapter interface  
- Perfect x402/permit/allowance verification  

### Mid-Term Goals  
- Build **standardized AI payment tools**  
- Enable "explainable payment decisions" for agents  
- Support multi-agent/payment collaboration models  

### Long-Term Goals  
- Create an **AI-native payment protocol layer**  
- Make payment a first-class capability for AI agents  
- Standardize AI-payment infrastructure
